        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few 
            implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to 
            let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can
             run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 
        </p><br />
        <p>
            Java applications are 
             typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the 
             underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level 
             facilities than either of them.The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and 
             runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

            The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be 
            displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
            and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
