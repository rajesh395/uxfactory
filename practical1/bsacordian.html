                    <strong>WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp, is an American freeware, cross-platform centralized
                        messaging and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc.[13] It allows users to send
                        text messages and voice messages,[14] make voice and video calls, and share images, documents,
                        user locations, and other content.[15][16] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices
                        but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains
                        connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app.[17] The service requires a cellular
                        mobile telephone number to sign up.[18] In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business
                        app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to
                        communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client

                        content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other
                        users to add their content to a personal feed.
